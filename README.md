## Description
It is a car robot that follows the black line to reach the color it read (blue - red - green).

It is a simple project about arduino and solidworks, and we do it with juniors also

## Game play idea
a- The player put the color card in front of the color sensor of the robot

b- The robot moves directly to skip point in track, to arrive to the correct color zone

c- The robot get out from the color zone to the end of the zone

d- The same steps are repeated with each color zone
